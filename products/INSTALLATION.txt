Pre-installation Test  Script - ashoptest.php

Before installing the program files, test the site to make sure that all of the server 
requirements are met. Download the pre-installation test script. Instructions are included with
it in a text file. Run the ashoptest.php script from a browser. If all of the tests pass, go 
ahead with the installation.


Installation of Software

1. Unzip the AShop program files on your local computer.
 
2. Use an FTP client, for example the free Filezilla, to upload the AShop files and folders to
your website. AShop may be installed in the public root directory to make the AShop storefront
your home page or in a subdirectory if you want to link to it from existing web pages. The AShop 
directory structure must remain the same as in the distibution package.
 
3. If necessary, change permissions of the following directories and files to 777. On some hosts
PHP is run under your own user account and already has full permissions to the files and folders
by default. Check with your hosting provider if you are unsure.

- admin/receipts (if you want to save original customer receipts)
- banners
- catalog
- images
- images/logo.gif
- previews
- prodimg
- products
- updates
 
4. Create a MySQL database for AShop and add a user with a password to the database. This can
usually be done through your hosting provider's control panel. The user must have full privileges
on the database.
 
5. Open config.inc.php in a text editor such as NotePad and edit the following variables:

- $databaseserver = "hostname for the MySQL server"

The database is usually located at "localhost", unless your hosting provider has a separate shared
MySQL server. Check with them if you are unsure.

- $databasename = "name of the MySQL database"
- $databaseuser = "user name that you added to the database that you created"
- $databasepasswd = "password for the user name that you added to the database"

6. Run install.php from a browser. This will create the database tables. To do this, enter something
like this into your browser address bar: http://www.yourdomain.com/install.php

7. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the installation.

You will now see the AShop administration panel login. The default password for the administrator 
is "ashopadmin". Login and setup the Configuration, then Edit Catalog to add categories and products.
For security we recommend that you change the administrator password on the page 
Configuration->Shop Parameters.
